In JavaScript, the term "script" can refer to different things depending on the context. Here's a breakdown:

1. HTML <script> Tag
In web development, the <script> tag is used to embed or reference JavaScript code within an HTML document.
Inline Script: The JavaScript code is written directly inside the <script> tag.
<script>
    console.log("Hello, world!");
</script>
External Script: The JavaScript code is in an external file, and the <script> tag links
to it using the src attribute.
<script src="app.js"></script>

2. A JavaScript Program or File
The term "script" can also mean a complete JavaScript program or file. For example:
A file named app.js that contains JavaScript code is referred to as a script.

3. JavaScript's Execution Context
In JavaScript, when a file or inline code is executed, it is often referred to as running a "script". In the context of execution:
Global Scope: Code running in a script is initially in the global scope unless encapsulated in a function or module.

4. Scripts in Node.js or Other Environments
In Node.js or other JavaScript environments, "script" may refer to a standalone JavaScript file executed as a program:
node script.js

5. Script as a Concept
In general programming terms, a script is a small program or
piece of code that performs a specific task. JavaScript is often
used for scripting in web development to add interactivity or automate tasks.
